Create a Class Library and a Test project that implements at least two of the following cryptographic techniques:
Hashing, Symmetric Encryption, Asymmetric Encryption, Digital Signing
The Class Library should contain the implementations and the Test project should verify those implementations
Ensure that your tests actually confirm that the implementations work as expected.
